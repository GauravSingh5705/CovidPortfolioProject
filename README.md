Analysis of Covid 19 Data for countries across the world.
Initial data in CSV format. Two files containing info regarding deaths and vaccination progress.
Imported the files into SQL server through SSMS.
Handled datatypes and got familiarized with the contents of columns.
Performed basic data inspection using SELECT statements.
Used Order By function to improve readability of results.
Performed ALTER operation to update datatypes.
Used WHERE function to filter specific data.
Performed basic mathematical calculations and used aggregate functions such MAX, SUM, AVG, etc.
Used Group By function to find data points for specific selections/ groups.
Used ALIASES to improve readability.
Used a combination of Partition By and Order By to find rolling sum.
Created a Common Table Expression(CTE) to use a calculated column for another calculation.
Created a Temporary table to use a calculated column in a further calculated column creation.
Created a View to be used later on for the purpose of Visualizing the data.
